== DESCRIPTION:

ffi-opengl is a ruby FFI interface towards OpenGL libraries (GL, GLU,
GLUT) autogenerated using ffi-swig-generator (see LINKS below). The
FFI layer ensures compatibility among all Ruby implementation that
support it. At the moment, this means that you can run the same
ffi-opengl script with MRI Ruby and JRuby (not tested on rubinius).

ffi-opengl API aims to be a 1:1 tranposition of the OpenGL C API: so
don't expect idiomatic ruby inside!

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Full [auto-generated] wrap of the OpenGL libraries.

* JRuby 1.3.0 compatible.

* No need of opengl development libraries.

* No compilation needed (once you have ruby-ffi installed or you are
  using JRuby).

* Not yet tested on windows platform.

== SYNOPSIS:

See the example in 'examples/' folder. For the API documentation
please refer to OpenGL reference pages.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ffi >= 0.3.0
* OpenGL libraries >= 1.2
